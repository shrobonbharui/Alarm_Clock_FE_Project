# Alarm_Clock_FE_Project
  The alarm clock project is a simple web-based application that allows users to set and manage alarms.The user interface consists of a digital clock display, input fields for setting the alarm time, buttons for starting and stopping alarms. A sound  to indicate when the alarm goes off.

  To create the interface, HTML is used to structure the page and define the elements of the user interface, including the clock display, input fields, and buttons. CSS is used to style the interface, making it visually appealing and easy to use.
  JavaScript is used to handle the logic of the application, including setting and managing alarms, updating the clock display, and triggering the alarm sound. When the user sets an alarm, JavaScript stores the time in a variable and checks it against the current time displayed on the clock. When the alarm time matches the current time, the alarm sound is triggered and the user is notified.

  Overall, the alarm clock project is a great way to practice using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a functional and interactive web application.
